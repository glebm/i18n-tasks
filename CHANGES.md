Fixes an issue with normalization not happening in certain cases.
[#91b593d7](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks/commit/91b593d7259460e2a3aa7fd731d878e8e35707fc)

There is now a minitest template file available.
[#250](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks/pull/250)

Internally, Erubi is now used instead of Erubis for parsing the config file.
[#247](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks/issues/247)

## v0.9.16

Improves handling of interpolations in `translate-missing` when multiple interpolations are present.

## v0.9.15

Adds new configuration options to the built-in scanners to enable support for non-standard messages and receivers.

For example, to support the [`it` gem](https://github.com/iGEL/it):

```ruby
# lib/i18n_tasks_it.rb
# The "it" gem support for i18n-tasks
I18n::Tasks.add_scanner(
  '::I18n::Tasks::Scanners::RubyAstScanner',
  receiver_messages: [nil, AST::Node.new(:const, [nil, :It])].product(%i[it]),
  only: %w[*.rb]
)
I18n::Tasks.add_scanner(
  '::I18n::Tasks::Scanners::PatternWithScopeScanner',
  translate_call: /(?<=^|[^\w'\-.]|[^\w'\-]It\.|It\.)it/,
  exclude: %w[*.rb]
)
```

```yaml

<% require './lib/i18n_tasks_it' %>
```

## v0.9.14

This release fixes an issue with dynamic scope arguments in views.

This affects calls like the following:

```erb
<%= t('key', scope: dynamic) %>
```

* `search.exclude` now appends to and not overrides the default exclude list. More extensions excluded by default:
  *.css, *.sass, *.scss, *.less, *.yml, and *.json. [#137](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks/issues/137).

## 0.7.13

## 0.7.0

New tasks:

* `i18n-tasks irb` for debugging
* This release is a major refactoring to use real trees internally (as opposed to nested hashes).
Real trees allow for much easier [traversal](/lib/i18n/tasks/data/tree/traversal.rb).
With these trees, information can be associated with each node, which allows for things like the conservative router.
* Accept keys with dashes (`-`) [#64](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks/issues/64).

## 0.3.11
